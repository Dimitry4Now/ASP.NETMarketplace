# Marketplace application

## General idea

The idea was to make a Marketplace style application in order to renew my knowledge of C# and ASP.NET MVC

## About the project

I generaly used Bootstrap for the frontend, along with the Views from ASP.NET

The project consists of:

- Dashboard(Main menu a.k.a. Index Page)
	- NavBar
	- List of products(Vehicles in my case)
- Details page(Opens on click on item)
	- General info about the selected item
	- Contact button(Not yet implemented)
	- Back to products(Back to Dashboard)
- Admin page
	- Table representation of all items
	- Edit button for each item
	- Delete button for each item
	- Create new item option(button)

## Feature plans

I plan on keeping the work on this project and we will see where it goes. Possible stuff i can add:

- Authentication level User
- Option for users to add items to the marketplace
- Implement the Contact seller option
- Add more types of items, not to stick just to vehicles
- . . .
